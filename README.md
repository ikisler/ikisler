## Hello! 👋

I'm a backend software engineer interested in working on projects with a positive impact.

With my background in business, I appreciate how technical needs integrate with the overall business needs, and take a pragmatic approach to balancing these sometimes opposing forces.  In my current role, I've worn many different hats -- this has helped me learn how to think on my feet and how to pick up new technologies quickly.
